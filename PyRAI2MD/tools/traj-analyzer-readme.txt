4. General tips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Step 1. check the completeness of trajectory
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The input file looks like below

    title file_name
    mode diag
    read_index list.txt

    The list.txt is a file containing the path to all trajectories, looks like below:

    /path/to/traj_1
    /path/to/traj_1
    /path/to/traj_1
    ...
    /path/to/traj_n

    It will compare the number of steps in all logfile and save the path to the
    completed one in a file, called 'complete'. We can use 'complete' to read
    completed trajectories instead of reading all of them from list.txt.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Step 2. check energy conservation of trajectory.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The input file looks like below:

    title file_name
    mode cons
    read_index complete
    maxdrift 0.05
    maxstep 200

    After checking the completeness of trajectory, we can determine an appropriate
    maxstep to process the trajectory data.

    It will read completed trajectory and compute energy drift. Any trajectory
    has total energy drift exceeding the maxdrift, will not be selected. It saves
    the path to the selected trajectories in a file, called 'conserved'. We can use
    'conserved' to read the trajectories for later analysis.

    The energy drift of each step are saved in energy_drift.txt.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Step 3. extract trajectory data
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The input file looks like below:

    title file_name
    mode read
    read_index conserved
    save_traj 1
    maxstep 200

    This step is optional, because the following steps can automatically read trajectories
    if the trajectory data generated in this step is not found.

    Keep the maxstep to read the conserved trajectory. It will save the trajectory data
    in a portable $file_name.json. Note that when reading thousands of trajectories, the
    JSON file could be large, so saving and loading it might be slower than re-reading them
    from logfile. In this case, set save_traj to 0 to save time.

    In any case, it will save all hop and final snapshots in Geom-$file_name.json and individual
    xyz files according to the final state of the trajectory, e.g., Ini.Sn.xyz, Fin.Sn.xyz, Hop.Sn.xyz

    Note the geometrical data filename starts with an uppercase 'G'. A different file with a lowercase 'g'
    is generated by mode 'pmd' or '8'.

    Note: in dissociation reaction, the long distance could cause artificial back surface hopping from a lower
    state to a higher state, which make the trajectory analysis based on the final state very difficult. In this
    case, one can prune the trajectory, so the analysis will be done before encountering the artificial back surface
    hopping at long distance. An example looks like:

    prune_type dist
    prune_index 1 2, 3 4
    prune_thrhd 3.0  4.0

    The keyword prune_type activate the prune function using inter-atomic distances.
    The keyword prune_index define two distance between atom 1 and 2 and atom 3 and 4.
    The keyword prune_thrhd will stop reading trajectory when the distance 1-2 is longer than 3.0 Angstrom, or the
    distance 3-4 is longer than 4.0 Angstrom.

    The following steps can be done independently.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Step 4. compute state population
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The input file looks like below:

    title file_name
    mode pop
    read_index conserved
    save_traj 1
    maxstep 200
    save_data 0

    When $file_name.json is available, read_index, save_traj, maxstep have no effect. Otherwise,
    they will be used to automatically read trajectory data before compute state population.

    In default, save_data 0 only compute the average state population and write them in average-$file_name.dat.
    The option 1 will write state population for all trajectories in state-pop-$file_name.json.
    The option 2 will write kinetic energy, potential energy, and total energy of all trajectories in
    energy-profile-$file_name.json.

    Sometimes, trajectory could fail with exploded structures, which should be removed from analysis.
    To do so, use keyword 'select' as following:

    select 1-5 7-10

    This will skip the 6th trajectory. Alternatively, you can provide a file containing this information:

    select file.txt

    The file.txt can have multiple line, each contain can have multiple index or group of index, e.g.:

    1-5 7-10
    11 12 13 16-20

    Now, the state population analysis will automatically find the trajectories early stopped, failed with nan state
    population, or population exceeding 0-1 in the excited states. These trajectories will be excluded from the state
    population average.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Step 5. classify trajectory
    This option can extract all initial, final, and hopping snapshot for alignment and computing geometrical parameters
    The input file looks like below:

    title file_name
    mode cat
    read_index conserved
    save_traj 1
    maxstep 200
    classify final
    classify_state 1
    align 1
    align_core 1-5
    output_atom 1-10
    param B 1 2 B 3 4
    threshold 2.5 2.5

    It will find Geom-$file_name.json generated in Step 3. It will automatically re-read
    trajectory if Geom-$file_name.json is not available.

    The keyword 'classify' decides the snapshot to classify trajectory. The keyword
    'classify_state' decides final state of the trajectories to be classified starting from 0.
    The keyword 'param' defines the geometrical parameters used for classification. Omitting this keyword
    will skip the geometrical parameter calculations. This could be used if you just want to align snapshots

    The keyword 'align' enable the alignment calculation. The keyword 'align_core' set specific atoms for
    alignment. The keyword 'output_atom' selects the atoms that will be saved in the aligned snapshots.
    The filenames of the aligned snapshots start with 'aligned-'.

    The keyword threshold provide the values to classify trajectory. It labels trajectory with
    a series of 1 or 0 if the geometrical parameters are greater or smaller than the thresholds.
    Omitting this keyword will set all thresholds to 0.

    The computed geometrical parameters are saved in
    param-%file_name.Sn.ini for initial snapshots,
    param-%file_name.Sn.fin for final snapshots, and
    param-%file_name.Sn.hop for hop snapshots.
    In above files, the first column is the traj index, the following columns are parameters.
    After the parameters, it prints the step of the snapshot and the potential energies of all states.

    The keyword 'select' is also available to remove undesired trajectory in classification.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Step 6. compute geometrical parameters for trajectory plot
    The input file looks like below:

    title file_name
    mode plot
    read_index conserved
    save_traj 1
    maxstep 200
    param B 1 2 B 3 4
    select file.txt

    When $file_name.json is available, read_index, save_traj, maxstep have no effect. Otherwise,
    they will be used to automatically read trajectory data before compute plot data.

    The keyword 'param' defines the geometrical parameters used for plot data calculation
    The keyword 'select' decides the trajectories to compute plot data. If not provided, all trajectories
    will be included.

    It will save the data in plot-$file_name.json

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Step 7. fetch a selected trajectory for visualization
    The input file looks like below:

    title file_name
    mode out
    read_index conserved
    save_traj 1
    maxstep 200
    select 1

    When $file_name.json is available, read_index, save_traj, maxstep have no effect. Otherwise,
    they will be used to automatically read trajectory data before fetching trajectory data.

    The keyword 'select' decides the trajectories to fetch. If not provided, it will stop.

    It will save the selected trajectory in select-$file_name-$index.xyz and the corresponding data
    in select-$file_name-$index.dat

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Special step. fast mode to compute geometrical parameters of PyRAI2MD trajectories
    When using buffer option in PyRAI2MD, the output file might miss recording a surface hopping point
    in the .md.xyz file. However, the information is available in the .sh.xyz. This special step will
    extract information from there.

    The input file look similar to Step 5 and 6.

    title file_name
    mode pmd
    read_index conserved
    classify all
    classify_state 0
    align 1
    align_core 1-5
    output_atom 1-10
    read_init file.init.xyz
    param B 1 2 B 3 4
    select file.txt

    The keyword 'classify' controls the type of snapshots to read, e.g., init, final, or hop
    When 'init' or 'final' are requested, it will read all md.xyz files. When 'hop' is requested, it will
    read all sh.xyz files. All data will be saved in geom-$file_name.json. If the file exists in
    the current folder, it will be directly loaded. Note this file start with a lowercase 'g'.

    The keyword 'classify_state' determine the final state of hopping point that will be considered.
    The value 0 means hopping from state 1 to state 0. The value 1 means hopping from state 2 to state 1.
    Currently, it does not support the reverse hopping from a lower state to a higher state.
    It has no effect for initial or final snapshots.

    The keyword 'align', 'align_core', and 'output_atom' work in the same way as in Step 5. However, the
    snapshots are saved in different names, e.g. ini.pmd.xyz, fin.pmd.xyz, and hop.pmd.xyz. The aligned
    snapshots are saved in, e.g, aligned-ini.pmd.xyz, aligned-fin.pmd.xyz, aligned-hop.pmd.xyz.

    The keyword 'read_init' read the initial snapshots directly from an initial condition file .init or .init.xyz
    instead of the trajectory logfiles. Since the initial condition file has no information of energies, they will
    be set to 0.

    When keyword param is used, the computed parameters are saved in different names from Step 5.
    For instances,
    param-%file_name.pmd.ini for initial snapshots,
    param-%file_name.pmd.fin for final snapshots, and
    param-%file_name.pmd.hop for hop snapshots.
    In above files, the first column is the traj index, the following columns are parameters.
    After the parameters, it prints the step of the snapshot and the potential energies of all states.
    When the keyword 'read_init' is used, the potential energies will be 0.

    The keyword 'select' decides the trajectories to compute the geometrical parameters for surface hopping
    point. Omitting this keyword will use all trajectories. It is recommended to use a list file containing the
    indices of all ground-state trajectories together with classify_state of 0. This will only consider the last
    surface hopping to the ground-state of the trajectories in the ground-state.
